# React-Routes

1. Websites are 2 types based on how we get content
    1. MPA - Multi Page Application
    2. SPA - Single Page Application
2. It helps us to navigate on website from one page to other and also helps within page from one component to other also.
3. In React, we build SPAs using React-Router. For this we use third party package "react-router-dom".
